# Data Tutorials

A collection of data science tutorials.

|Analytics Tutorials|
|---|
|**Sample Data Analytics Notebook**<br>_A sample of how to structure a data analytics project on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks._|
|**Data Visualizations**<br>_A toy notebook for plotting data using [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)._|
|**Cython for NumPy**<br>_A introductory tutorial to writing efficient code in Python using the [Cython](https://github.com/python/cpython) implementation._|
|**Executing Cython Code**<br>_Another tutorial for writing efficient code in Python using the [Cython](https://github.com/python/cpython) implementation._|
|**Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**<br>_Let's talk about efficiency in Python._|
|**Random Queries**<br>_Collection of my most frequently used SQL queries & SQL tutorial revisions and exercises._|
|**Regression Analysis**<br>_An exploration of the different types of regression analysis. We also dive into the different estimation methods, comparing & contrasting the different approaches, as well as uses in practice._|
|**Basics of Cython**<br>_An introduction to writing optimized Python code with minimal effort. This repo also shows the inter-play between C and Python with an easy to use API._|
|**Py-Mongo**<br>_An introductory tutorial on working with MongoDB using Python._|
|**Python-Cassandra**<br>_Tutorial on the Cassandra database using the Python driver._|
|**Performance Comparison: Pure Python vs. NumPy vs. TensorFlow**<br>_Python has several libraries make use of its ease of use while lending the ability to perform numerical computations efficiently. The purpose of this tutorial is to explore the improvements that can be achieved by using [NumPy](http://numpy.org) and/or [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)._|
|**Parallel Programming in Python**<br>_How does parallel programming in Python work? How do we do it? We'll use the `multiprocessing` module to demonstrate how we can carry out parallel programming in Python and how to analyse large datasets by using all of our machine cores._|
|**Simple Classification with** `Sci-kit Learn`<br>_An introductory script illustrating the ease of carrying our a classification task with Python's [`Sci-kit Learn`](https://scikit-learn.org)._|

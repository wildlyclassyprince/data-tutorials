    "That is, the probability of being in the optimal position is a fraction of the total number of items under consideration. However the probability of being selected is $0$ because we discard all options before we reach the stopping point.\n",

    "\n",
    "$P(n) = \\frac{1}{N}$, $P(s) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability of being in the optimal position is still a fraction of the total number of items under consideration. But the probability of being selected is $1$ since we are now considering the first item after the stopping point. It is better than all the options before the stopping position, then we will definitely pick it.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, the probability of being in the optimal position does not change. The probability of being selected is given by the difference between the size of the total probability space, $1$, and probability of not being selected, $P(s^{'})$.\n",
